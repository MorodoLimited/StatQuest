    "- Fitting the Training Data well but making poor predictions is called the __Bias-Varience Tradeoff__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea about choosing the best machine learning method is __how well a method performs on testing data__. It can be any method performs well with your problem. \n",

    "- Want to use the variables Chest Pain, Good Blood Circ, Blocked Arteries, Weight to predict if smo has heart disease. Using the data we have below, we can learn.\n",

    "| --- | --- | --- |--- | --- |\n",

    "- __The important question is which machine learning method we should use to solve this problem__. Logistic regession, SVM, k-NN ...? __Cross Validation__ lets us compare different machine learning methods.\n",
